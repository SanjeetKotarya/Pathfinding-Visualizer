Features:
- Visualize pathfinding algorithms in real-time.
- Explore and interact with different maze generation techniques.
- Responsive and user-friendly design with Tailwind CSS.

Technologies Used:
- React: For building the user interface.
- TypeScript: To ensure type safety and improve code quality.
- Tailwind CSS: For a modern and responsive design.

How to Run:
